# RailsLite

Rails Lite is an academic exercise in implementing the main functionality of Rails and its ability to leverage convention over configuration.

The purpose was to deeply understand how Rails works, with a focus on Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and meta-programming. It is written in pure Ruby.

## Demo

Some specs have been written to demonstrate the functionality of the project. To run the specs:

1. In terminal, `git clone https://github.com/JoyJing1/RailsLite.git`
2. `cd RailsLite`

Running them in the following order will follow the progression of the project.

### Suggested Order
1. `rspec spec/p00_controller_spec.rb`
2. `rspec spec/p01_template_spec.rb`
3. `rspec spec/p02_session_spec.rb`
4. `rspec spec/p03_router_spec.rb`
5. `rspec spec/p04_integration_spec.rb`
5. `rspec spec/p05_flash_spec.rb`
5. `rspec spec/p06_exceptions_spec.rb`
5. `rspec spec/p07_static_spec.rb`
5. `rspec spec/p08_csrf_spec.rb`
